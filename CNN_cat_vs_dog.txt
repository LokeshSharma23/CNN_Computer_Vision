# Computer Vision Project : Classifying Dog vs Cat images using CNN
# Convolution Neural Network

# Aim: To classify the images of Dog vs Cat using Convolution Neural Network and Keras-Tensorflow backend

# Dataset: Data consists of 10000 images of Cats and Dogs

# Model Building Steps:
1. Importing Keras libraries using tensorflow backend.
2. Initializing the CNN input layer using Sequential class
3. Adding first 2D Convolution layer
4. Adding second 2D Convolution layer
5. Performing MaxPooling to get the more information with less data.
6. Flattening the maxpooling result to feed into neural network.
7. Building full connection using Dense module and Rectifier acitvation function for input layer and 
   Sigmoid function for output layer.
8. Compiling the CNN using 'adam' optimization algorithm and 'binary_crossentropy' loss function.
9. Fitting the CNN to the images using Keras ImageDataGenerator
10. Fitting the model to the training set
11. Testing the model on new images


# Results:

Model's classification accuracy: 81%
